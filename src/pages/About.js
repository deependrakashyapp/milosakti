              <p>
                At Millo Shakti, our mission is to eradicate malnutrition in common people, especially in children, 
                breastfeeding mothers, construction laborers, and people below the poverty line. We provide high-quality 
                organic, millet, and natural products at very low prices to reach even the last person.
              </p>
              <p>
                In today's scenario, in 13 states out of its 63 districts, more than half of the kids are dwarfs 
                (short size according to age). The main reason for this is not having a nutritional diet. 
                We are committed to solving this problem through our quality products.

              <h2>Our Legacy</h2>
              <p>
                Millo Shakti was founded by senior social worker and agri-entrepreneur Ritu Raj Bass. 
                Dr. Badri Prasad Bass established a supermarket around Bareilly Mandal in 1880, where organic, 
                Ayurvedic, and other natural products were available in one place. After that, his great-grandson, 
                Dr. Gopal Krishna Bass, understanding the importance of natural products, and with the goal of making 
                the community healthy and disease-free, created natural products using natural methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, the BASS group is known for quality and is also known as the "Father of Organics." 
                On his same path, his grandson Dr. Gopal Krishan Bass laid the foundation stone of Kunj Bass Labs 
                in 1965, in which he manufactured Ayurvedic and millet-based protein powder.
              </p>
              <p>
                140-year-old trustworthy and quality-focused, Millo Shakti is committed to ending malnutrition 
                in the present time. This will include organic, millets, and all natural products. 
                The dream of a healthy and developed India will be fulfilled.
